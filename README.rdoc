Hi,
This is a simple book review web application that i have developed using Rails 3. This application is build as part of my reading and practising the tutorial avaiable at http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/zero-to-sixty-creating-and-deploying-a-rails-app-in-under-an-hour/. The tutorial uses Rails 2 while the one available here is on Rails 3.
